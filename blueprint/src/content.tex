\chapter{The ring of integers of a quadratic field}

Let $d$ be an integer different from $0$ and $1$. We also assume that $d$ is squarefree.
 We write $K$ for the subring of $\C$ generated by $\sqrt{d}$. By our assumptions on $d$, we have that $K = \Q(\sqrt{d})$
 is a field.

\begin{lemma}
  We have that $d \equiv \pm 1 \bmod 4$ or $d \equiv 2 \bmod 4$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
If $d \equiv 0 \bmod 4$ than $d$ would not be squarefree.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  We have that $\sqrt{d} \in \mathcal{O}_K$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Clear since $\sqrt{d}$ is a root of $x^2-d$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  If $d \equiv 1 \bmod{4}$ then $\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2} \in \mathcal{O}_K$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Write $d = 4a + 1$, with $a \in \Z$. Then $\sqrt{d}$ is a root of $x^2 - x - a \in \Z[x]$.
\end{proof}
